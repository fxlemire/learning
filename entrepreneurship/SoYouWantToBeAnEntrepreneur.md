So You Want To Be An Entrepreneur
=================================
Entrepreneurs who often dream of billions usually only reach a million or two (not that bad...)
# How to Make Money
* Sell Your Time
    * Doesn't scale well
* Sell Something You Own
    * Traders/Merchants/etc.
* Sell the Use of Things You Own
    * The more you own, the more you can make money
* Sell the Things you Create
    * The best scaling

It takes skills to be an entrepreneur, but those skills can be learnt.
50% of the population were self-employed in the 1800s.

# Goals, Personal and Corporate
## Entrepreneurship is about money
Harsh, but nonetheless true.

Kind of goals:
* Change the world
* Be your own boss
* Sleep in

If it wasn't about the money, one could volunteer to change the world instead...

Still, those goals are important, they allow to define what money means to us.

If the goal is to be our own boss, VC is not the way to go, because they will watch every move we make.

If the goal is to get a mansion, the entrepreneur might take a riskier path that will pay off big time.

So it is important to know how much money defines a success in our personal view.

## Risks
If you cannot tolerate risks, stop trying to become an entrepreneur.

Becoming an entrepreneur is a lifestyle choice, and very hard to reverse. Be wary!

## Startup Design Patterns
* Grow Fast, Grow Big, Exit
    * Raise money, grow quickly, sell the company
* Niche/Specialized - Moderate Growth
    * Fill a specific need (like me)
    * Not necessarily attractive to VC Firms, the potential exit is not big enough, but it can provide a nice profitable steady business nonetheless!
    * prone to bootstrapping/creative financing
* Lifestyle - Profitable and Stable
    * crowdsourcing, family

## Choosing Your Path
* Choose your pattern based on your needs, not on popularity
* Remember your goals and interests
* Respect your idea. Different investors/advisors may have different agendas or share different vision/values.
* Focus on loving your idea and getting the right clients for it.

# Do You Have What It Takes
Investors invest on people, not ideas.

Entrepreneurship is about character, attitude and skills.

## Confidence
* Self-esteem is the key to success.
* You will face a great deal of skepticism and doubt. You need a bit of conceit.
* Things to be afraid of:
    * My company will fail
    * I'll ship something defective
    * My employees will become unemployed and suffer financial hardship
    * My customers will hate me

Yes, these things will happen. And you will be the one blamed for it. Be ready to face that.
Often, you will have to take blind decisions that will impact your employees. Most of the time you will be guessing because there are factors out of your control.

Be courageous.

## Risk Tolerance
Understand your risk tolerance with the following questions:
* How will you deal witwh failure?
    * What will you do if you fail? What will you do if you lose your entire investment?
* What is the personal cost of this venture?
    * If you fail, will your spouse divorce you? Will you commit suicide?
    * Will it destroy your health? Will you never see your family?
    * If that comes up... you're taking way too much risk!
* What is the financial cost of this venture?

Early career low-risks:
* low epenses
* lots of time to recover from failure

Late career low-risks:
* Extra savings/assets available
* Lower expenses (kids are self-supporting)

Mid-career high risks:
* High expenses
* Large commitments

Rule: Never Risk What You Are Not Willing To Lose

## Stress Tolerance
* A shit ton of symptoms...
* BUT! actually, CEOs tend to be healthier than their employees.
    * I can speak for a fact that I indeed got into healthy habits since I started working on my company
        * Higher self-discipline with regards to exercise and diet
        * It's good to be the boss
        * Get to sleep late when you want to
        * If you wake up early, it's because you want to, not because somebody else wants you to.

## Business Skills
* Basic accounting / bookkeeping
* Graphics
* Writing
* Marketing and advertising
* Web
* Public Relations
* Legal
    * Protecting IP / Sales Agreements / Stocks / Partnership Agreements / etc.
* Sales
* Human Resources
* IT
    * software licenses / emails / web services / phones / internet access
* Office

These things need to be done.
* Hire people to do it for you: gets highly expensive
* Do them yourselves
    * online courses
    * books
    * occasional consultation with experts
* Do it yourself and have an expert polishing it
* One big thing to note: the experts in these various fields often are not very good at what they do.

## Technical Skills
* You don't necessarily need to be a "top coder"
* You can be an *entrepreneurial coder*
    * An entrepreneurial coder writes code based on the economics of the code, not performance/efficiency/popularity/etc.

Economics:
* Coding is maybe 20% of your lifecycle costs.
* Buy instead of build? Long-term risks?
* Consider the cost/benefit ratio

Taking Shortcuts: Neglecting documentation/unit tests/etc.

But that accumulates technological debt/deficit, that you have to tackle the moment you have resources in spare

Understand the risk and cost of every single decision you make.

* Know when to ignore total lifecycle costs
* Find an economic justification for every technical decision
* Don't get blinded by technology

## Management Skills
* Manage yourself first (self-discipline)
    * This is usually not a problem since you're already on the entrepreneurial path in the first place.
    * But what can be a problem is to know when to take breaks: eat well, sleep well, get a life
* You can learn
* You can hire
* When experience is needed, evaluate each individual on their own merits. It's not because the person has grey hair that things will go smoothly.
* Choose between CEO/VP-Engineering/CTO. You can't do all of them
* Managing growth is really hard
    * You may not be able to grow fast enough to do it yourself
    * Zuckerberg/Gates are geniuses not only because of their technical geniuses:
    also because they could maintain control and significant ownership of their company while growing in from nothing into huge organizations
    * It's common that you can't handle the transition.
        * Larry Page and Steve Jobs handed down their CEO position for a while because they couldn't handle the growth.

## Strenghts and weaknesses
* Play to your strengths - compensate for your weaknesses
    * Partner with others who are strong where you are weak

## The vision
* You need a belief and passion that will carry you through the rough times.
* Visions can be shared
* It makes sense that the CEO is the originator of the vision

Do You Have What It Takes?

# The Idea
* Ideas are cheap
* Ideas are easy
* Execution is everything

## Finding ideas
To be creative: don't be scared of being stupid. Spit out all the ideas. Don't filter them out.
Try to come up with the worst ideas possible. Surprisingly, some will be good!

Never stop looking for ideas. Don't think the first idea you came up with is the best one you came up with.

## Ideas, big and small
* Big ideas
    * large market/mass market, requires heavy investment
* Smaller ideas
    * limited market, limited development, infrastructure and marketing costs

## Barriers to Entry
* Simple ideas are bad
    * Other companies can incorporate your idea into their existing product
    * Others can copy and execute before you can
    * If you create a company around a simple idea, you need to create barriers of entry, that is, strategies to slow down or stop the competition
* Hard ideas are better
    * Stealth Mode can help. Nobody really knows what they're working on, so they get a head start.

### Common Barriers of entry:
* Target a small market (less competition, so larger companies will not find it worthwhile)
* Target a market that requires specialized knowledge (domain knowledge)
* Legal techniques (patents and trade secrets)
* Gain dominant market share
* Be the best
* Be the cheapest
* Gain exclusivity to a key resource
    * Negotiate exclusive licenses
* Innovate like crazy

## Creating Demand vs Meeting Demand
Meeting is easier than creating, but creating might give a major competitive advantage.

### How To Know If Your Idea Meets a Demand?
* Ask potential customers if they like the idea
* Ask how much they would be willing to pay for it
* Don't just talk to friends
* Are you the customer?
    * In that case, the question you need to answer is: how many people face the same problems as you?
    * Eat Your Own Dog Food

* If Nobody likes it
    * Maybe you're wrong... Maybe you're right... But just make sure not to fall in love with your idea
        * It is important to be able to discard bad ideas and craete new ones

## The Next Big Thing
* Are you the next Google?
    * Probably not... But to be, don't follow the fads. You have to go against odds.
* Following the latest fad is perfectly ok
    * Even investors follow fads

## Timing
* A great idea for a dying market is a bad idea

## Competition
* Competition serves to prove a market actually exists
* Know your competition in order to differentiate yourself
    * Marketing is about telling a story. You'll need to have a story to differentiate yourself from the competitors

## Protecting Your Idea
* Too much secrecy is dangerous. Feedback is critically important. It can help finding and avoiding critical flaws.
    * We can be opened about the idea and goal but keep implementation secret.

Other possibilities:
* Trade secrets
* Trademarks and Copyrights
    * Protects the brand, not the idea
* Patents
    * Job security for lawyers :P
    * Mostly useful for huge companies

## Business Plans
* See it as a way to tell a story.
* A business plan is not really a business plan. They can't predict the future. Anyone who considers a business plan seriously is a fool.
* They help thinking about how your idea translates into a business
* They help convince investors that you are thinking like an entrepreneur
* They force you to consider all aspects of a business

### Important Topics
* The people
    * What skills do they bring?
* The idea
    * What problem are you solving? Are you meeting/creating a need?
* The market
    * Do you know who your customers are? (to be distinguished with users)
* Competition
    * How will you compete? Who is your competition? Think several moves ahead
* Monetization
* Financial / business model
    * Who is the customer? What will they pay?
        * Helps to estimate a revenue growth
    * Development costs and resources
    * Operating costs
* Financial Plan
    * Describes how we plan to spend money over time

## Idea Mutation and Uncertainty
* Few ideas survive the reality of development unchanged
* Be ready to adapt and evolve (Microsoft and eBay did it)
    * Don't fall in love with your idea. It's simply an idea. Allow it to evolve.

Being an entrepreneur is being in a constant state of uncertainty.

The above questions are guides to help you decide whether you should try to turn your idea into a business. It helps gaging the risks and rewards.

Answer the questions and accept the fact that the answers are nothing but educated guesses. By doing so, you probably are ready to be an entrepreneur.

# The People
## The Founders
* Typically range from 1 to 4 people (usually 2)
* Sole Founder
    * Eliminates stress to resolve disagreements
    * No one to support you, no one else to blame or let you down
    * No risk of divergence in vision
* One cofounder
    * one more skillset
    * adds relationship complexity
    * someone to support you and back you up
* More cofounders
    * increases both risks and advantages of one cofounder

### Choosing a cofounder
* It's like a marriage
* You need a cofounder that can put up with you at your worst, and that you can tolerate at their worst
    * To minimize the risks, ideall go with someone you already know well. But be careful about closest friends, relationship could be ruined if business goes wrong
* Find someone different: look for skills, not knowledge
    * Consider character and integrity first. Confidence that you won't be betrayed.
* Don't look for someone to provide emotional support
    * Need for companionship of fear of beingg on your own are not a good basis for a partnership
    * If it's the case, work on your fear first, because even though you have a cofounder, you'll need to take decisions on your own. and if the partnership breaks up, you may find yourself in that spot regardless
    * If you lack the discipline to do the necessary work, having a cofounder isn't likely to help
    * *If you want a companion to be around and help with the work: hire an intern*
    * *If you want emotional support: buy a dog*
* Look for someone who will increase your chances of success

## Cofounder Relationships
Problems can arise when roles are not well defined. Sometimes, CEO is the clear leader, with the cofounder being close number 2. Sometimes, the CEO is first among equals.
Have periodic open discussions on the topic to avoid unclear/undefined relationships that develop resentment.

Make sure you understand what is going on with your cofounder roles. Never blindly trust and lag behind. Do the efforts to gain the necessary knowledge to understand the other side of the business.
This will avoid potential unfair decisions at your expense. *Trust but verify!* Greed can bring out the worst in people.
